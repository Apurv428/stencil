<p align="left">Stencil is an opinionated <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> framework to bootstrap efficient and scalable server-side applications <em>fast</em>. Stencil uses <a href="https://nestjs.com" target="_blank"> NestJS</a> at its core.</p>

## Description

[Stencil](https://github.com/SamagraX-stencil/stencil) framework TypeScript sample app depicting how to setup logging.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Setup dependent services
This example only shows how to setup the ELK (Elastic Search - Logstash - Kibana) Stack to enable logging in your app.
To setup these services run the following command
```bash
$ stencil add logging
```

The above command will create a folder named logging in the root of your application then you can use the individual folder level `docker-compose` files to start the services. 
No additional step of registering a component is required.

> Note: We are in the process of creating a generic logger which will connect with these servces to send logs here.
